                 <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.</li>
                      <li>I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</li>
                      <li>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful. </li>
                </ul>
